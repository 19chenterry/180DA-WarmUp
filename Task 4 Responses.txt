4.1 - In my testing, HSV yielded better results than RGB. I used a threshold range of [100,50,50] to [140,255,255] for HSV.
4.2 - There were no differences in the tracking ability of the object in different lighting environments.
4.3 - The phone brightness did affect the effectiveness of the tracking software. When the brightness of the phone is turned up to the maximum, the tracking box is much larger than the phone screen itself. This may be a result of the phone screen emitting blue light (which the software tracks) to its surrounding area, therefore, in the eyes of the tracking software, the area that falls within the threshold is larger, thus creating the larger tracking box.
4.4 - The non-phone object was more robust to the change of surrounding brightness changes. Since the object does not emit any light, it does not change the exposure settings within the camera, thus retaining more of the original color. As seen with the Phone Dark screenshot, the brightness from the screen had changed the exposure and white balance of the camera to perceive the color to be a lot lighter than it actually is. (The same color/brightness is used for both phone screenshots, the color is chosen to be similar to that of the notebook).
